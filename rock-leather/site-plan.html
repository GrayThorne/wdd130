      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to make a leather crafting website to sell products and raw materials for other to enjoy the craft. As well as have a community forum for the crafters to teach, learn and just talk to one another. Do you want to learn leather crafting, or be able to buy and enjoy others work? Having one place to do buy/sell and teach/learn as well as get the materials needed is what I want to provide.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is for anyone who is interested in working with leather. I want the experienced crafters to be able and willing to teach new crafters who want to learn. Being able to have a place for the beginner and expert to talk and buy supplies. Having a place to talk to others is a big part of what we do for everyone.</p>  <!-- change this -->
