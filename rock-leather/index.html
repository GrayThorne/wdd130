                <h1>Welcome to Rock Leather</h1>
                <p>
                    If you are here, you must have an interest in either leather products or leather crafting itself. We have both a place to buy and order custom work or premade leather goods as well as a wonderful leather crafter community. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Enjoy the wonders of leather and the beauty it brings to our lives and others. Leather crafting is a wonderful craft to make practical and beautiful pieces of art. The leather goods that are crafted can last a lifetime and the skills can be passed to new crafters that wish to learn.
