    <h2>Nathaniel Funk</h2>
    <h2>I usually go by Nate</h2>
    <p>I am going for a bachelors degree in programming.
        I like to leatherwork, woodwork and spend time with my family. I just started
        a new job that has more opportunity to move up and will be better for my family.
        I like that I can get my degree online so I can keep working and support my family.</p>
